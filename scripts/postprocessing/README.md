# postprocessing-deprecated

## this container and post-processing approach is no longer used, see [issue #42](https://github.com/c-scale-community/use-case-hisea/issues/42) 

This folder contains the files needed to build and run the docker container to postprocess the output from the Delft3D FM model run to a regular grid for further analysis.

The below script is called in docker container.

* `nc2regularGrid_listComprehension.py` \
  This script converts the Delft3D FM map output to a regular spaced grid. It expects 3 paramaters:
  - `mapfile`: An unpartitioned Delft3D FM NetCDF map output file
  - `xpoints`: number of points you wish to include into your regular grid
  - `ypoints`: number of points you wish to include into your regular grid

# Example Docker build

    docker build --tag postprocess .

# Example Docker run

    docker run -v /path/to/delf3dfm/output:/data/input -v /path/to/where/you/want/to/save/the/regular/gridded/data:/data/output postprocess tttz_waq_0000_map.nc 500 400

# Known issues
If pip fails run the below

    sudo su
    echo '{ "mtu": 1376 }' > /etc/docker/daemon.json
    sudo systemctl restart docker
