# notebooks
In this folder you will find Jupyter Notebooks and the files to build the docker container (`Dockerfile`and `environment.yaml`) to run the notebooks.

* `visualise_delft3dfm.ipynb` \
    notebook with examples on how to visualise Delft3D FM output
* `dev.ipynb` \
    development notebook for troubleshooting and bug fixes

## `docker build`

To build the docker image run

    docker build --tag dfmipynb .

## `docker run`

    docker run -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/home/jovyan/work -v /path/to/delft3dfm/output:/home/jovyan/work/data dfmipynb

The above command will return output similar to the below:

[I 2022-09-07 13:34:03.867 ServerApp] Jupyter Server 1.18.1 is running at:
[I 2022-09-07 13:34:03.867 ServerApp] http://8ca53708c6b0:8888/lab?token=...
[I 2022-09-07 13:34:03.867 ServerApp]  or http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=...

[C 2022-09-07 13:34:03.871 ServerApp] 
    
    To access the server, open this file in a browser:
        file:///home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/jpserver-7-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://8ca53708c6b0:8888/lab?token=...
     or http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=...
```

If you are running the above locally, copy and paste the URL starting with `http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=...` to your browser.

If you are running the above on a virtual machine in the cloud it is a bit more involved...

## getting the above to run on an openstack virtual machine in the cloud

1. Navigate to the OpenStack environment of your virtual machine cloud provider
2. On the left hand side, click on `Network/Security Groups`
3. Click `Create Security Group` and in the pop-up window give your security group a name and click `Create Security Group`
4. On the next page click `Add Rule` and do the following: \
    a. For `Rule`, select `Custom TCP Rule` \
    b. Provide a `Description` \
    c. For `Direction`, select `Ingress` \
    d. For `Open Port`, select `Port` (you can also select `Port Range`) \
    e. For `Port` insert `8888` (if you selected `Port Range` in the previous step insert e.g. `8899` in `To Port`) \
    f. `Remote` should be set to `CIDR` by default \
    g. `CIDR` should be set to `0.0.0.0/0` by default \
    e. Click `Add`
5. Navigate to `Compute/Instances`
6. For your `Instance Name`, on the far right under `Actions`, click on the drop-down menu and select `Edit Security Groups`
7. In the pop-up window, click on the blue plus sign to add `Security Group` you've just created to your instance, and click `Save`

Now, back in the terminal for your virtual machine run 

    docker run -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/home/jovyan/work -v /path/to/delft3dfm/output:/home/jovyan/work/data dfmipynb

Copy and paste the URL starting with `http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=...` to your browser but **replace** `127.0.0.1` with the public IP of the virtual machine you are working on.
